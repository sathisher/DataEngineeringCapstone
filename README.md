In this first part of the assignment, you will perform four exercises, but before proceeding with the assignment, you will prepare the lab environment by starting MySQL server, MongoDB server, and then downloading the files database from the given link. Further, you will import the data in the JSON file to a database and a collection, and the data in the SQL file to the MySQL server. You will also verify your access to the cloud instance of the IBM DB2 server.
